# MLR_4_SASEM
Machine Learning in R for users of SAS EM
Focus is on using the caret package to perform modelling steps

To use, download the project and install the following packages:
dplyr
caret
pacman
ROCR
ggplot2

Code will then run from the GCD_ML4SAS script (other scripts which contain functions are invoked by the source call)
